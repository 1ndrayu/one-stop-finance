# 🏦 One-Stop Finance API Hub

A unified financial infrastructure API designed to bring together all essential financial services — capital markets, debt issuance, asset tokenization, account management, payment systems, and programmable smart transactions — under a single modular platform.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**One-Stop Finance** is a backend system built to:
- Tokenize financial assets (credit, equity, real estate, etc.)
- Support debt creation, tracking, and repayment
- Enable peer-to-peer and market-based trading
- Facilitate seamless and programmable payment flows
- Serve as a plug-and-play hub for embedded fintech services

## 🧠 Vision

We aim to build a programmable API layer that combines the robustness of traditional finance with the flexibility of DeFi — usable by startups, co-operatives, and researchers alike. Think: **Stripe + Zerodha + DeFi Protocol** in one interface.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Architecture:** Modular, layered design (inspired by microservices)
- **Planned:** OAuth2 authentication, Webhooks, and E2E Encryption
