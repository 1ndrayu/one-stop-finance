A unified financial infrastructure API designed to integrate all major financial services — including capital markets, debt instruments, asset tokenization, account management, payments, and smart trading — into one cohesive platform.

Overview
One-Stop Finance is a modular API system that:
- Tokenizes assets (credit, equity, real estate, etc.)
- Manages financial instruments (debt, capital, savings)
- Enables seamless trading and transfers between tokenized accounts
- Facilitates real-time payments and capital flows
- Plans to integrate smart-contract-based compliance and settlement

It’s designed for developers, fintech startups, and researchers exploring composable financial protocols.
